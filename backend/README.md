# Backend Module

This folder is reserved for backend-specific code and API integrations.

## Purpose
- API routes and controllers
- Database models and migrations
- Business logic and services
- Authentication and authorization
- External service integrations

## Setup
Backend functionality can be added using:
- **Lovable Cloud** - Integrated backend with Supabase (database, auth, storage, edge functions)
- **External APIs** - Connect to third-party services
- **Serverless Functions** - Deploy edge functions for custom logic

## Getting Started
When you're ready to add backend functionality, you can enable Lovable Cloud through the project settings or integrate external services as needed.
